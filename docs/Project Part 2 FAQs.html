<h2>General Question</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>There is a page limit for the reports. What if I exceeded the page limit?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>The teaching team will only mark the pages within the page limit, subsequent pages will be ignored.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I’m not sure what additional features I can implement for the project. What should I do?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Please refer to the suggestions provided in the project specifications. For each part of the project, there is a guided additional feature which you can try. You can them in the&nbsp; <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=815629&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=927FAFEA-F39E-47A2-A004-9FE5405E0231-5344750" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Additional Features Guide.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Project Part 1</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is this an individual or group project?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Due to the nature of the subject, you would need to form a group to work on Project Part 1.</li>
<li>However, each student is assessed individually. You will implement the code for your own proposed feature&nbsp; independently and write your own report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What is considered a "feature" in the context of this project?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>A feature refers to any CRUD operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete).</li>
<li>The feature must demonstrate a complexity level ranging from average to high.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How is the complexity level of average to high defined?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>As a guide, features that interact with the database and encompasses alternate scenarios (success and at least two other error cases) will typically meet the required complexity level.&nbsp;</li>
<li>E.g. Create resource is a suitable function as the function can
<ul>
<li>contain multiple alternate scenarios, such as:<br>
<ul>
<li>All required fields properly filled up</li>
<li>Some required fields not filled up</li>
<li>All required fields filled up but contains invalid data (e.g. NRIC number is invalid, etc)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>and interacts with the database as the data will be inserted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>E.g. A typical "delete resource" on the other hand is not a good function as it doesn't encompass much alternate scenario. However, it will fulfill the complexity level if it's enhanced with a confirmation field before deletion.<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>If my groupmate had already chosen a "Create" feature, can I implement another "Create" feature.</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Yes, you may, as long as it is not the same feature.</li>
<li>E.g. Your groupmate can work on "Create blog post" while you work on "Create comment".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Can I implement more than one feature?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>No, each student is only required to implement one feature. There are no extra marks for implementing additional features. In the event that you chose to go against this and implement more than one feature, the teaching team will only mark the first feature that we see in your report (which might not be your best feature).</li>
<li>However, if supporting features are needed, you may implement them but you should state clearly in your report on the chosen feature that the teaching team will mark.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What are the deliverables for Project Part 1?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Each student is required to submit a Word document report.</li>
<li>Each group is required to submit their source code, PPT slides and do a presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What should we do if one teammate is not cooperating or hasn't completed their part of the project on time, even though we're working collaboratively on GitHub and had set realistic milestones and deadlines?</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is why clear communication, regular updates and a shared project plan are essential in collaborative work. If a teammate is falling behind beyond the agreed timeline and there's evidence of ongoing, documented communication, the rest of the team can proceed:
<ul>
<li>Go ahead and merge the completed features into the main branch for submission.</li>
<li>Note the commit ID of the final working version.</li>
<li>Submit that version as the group’s main contribution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The teammate who is behind can complete their part and merge their work separately later, creating a second copy of the code for submission if necessary.</li>
<li>Please also inform your tutor so that he/she can speak to your teammate and expect multiple code submissions from your team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Project Part 2</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do I need to continue collaborating with my groupmate for Project Part 2?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>No, you do not need to.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You will fork the repository from Part 1 and work independently from Project Part 2 onwards.
<ul>
<li>Forking a repository means&nbsp;you can make any changes you want to the code without affecting the original project.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How do I fork the repository from Part 1 into my own repository?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li><span>Please refer to the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=815629&amp;type=news&amp;rcode=927FAFEA-F39E-47A2-A004-9FE5405E0231-5484203" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>video recording</span></a> in the Project Part 2 briefing announcement.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Can I modify my groupmates' features after forking the repository?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Yes, you can make changes to your team members' features, but you will not receive extra marks for this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Can I modify my own feature after forking the repository for Project Part 2?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Yes, you can modify your own feature to for example, cover more alternative scenarios, but you are not allowed to change the core functionality of the function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What testing is required for Project Part 2?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>You must perform backend unit testing, API testing and frontend testing on your proposed feature and gather the both the backend and frontend code coverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Do I need to perform testing for my groupmates' features?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>No, you do not need to.</li>
<li>Marks may also be deducted due to unrepresentative code coverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Do I need to gather overall code coverage for the entire application?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>No, you do not need to as you are only expected to perform testing on your proposed feature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Can I use testing frameworks other than Jest and Playwright?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>You may propose and implement another backend or front-end testing framework, but you must also implement backend unit testing and API testing using Jest and front-end testing using Playwright.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What are the deliverables for Project Part 2?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Each student is required to submit a Word document report and their source code.<strong></strong></li>
<li>You are also required to do a demonstration of your testing and code coverage implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>For the additional feature, if I implement an alternative testing tool or framework, am I required to rewrite all the existing test cases that were originally written using Jest/Playwright?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Yes. All existing test cases should be rewritten in the new testing tool or framework to ensure completeness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>There are multiple code coverage metrics. Which ones will I be evaluated on?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>All of them. Ensure that every coverage metric meets or exceeds the target percentage you are aiming for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Project Part 3</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is required for Project Part 3?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>You are required to implement CI/CD pipeline to automate build, test and deployment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Is it okay to use tools other than Jenkins, Docker, and Minikube?</strong>
<ul>
<li>You may propose and implement another CI/CD, containerization, and container orchestration tool, but you must also implement the CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker and Minikube.<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What are the deliverables for Project Part 3?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Each student is required to submit a Word document report and their source code.</li>
<li>You are also required to do a demonstration of your CI/CD pipeline implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What if I couldn't manage to implement any additional feature?</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>You can comment out the code (if it's breaking your application or pipeline) and still write about it in under the "Additional features" section of your report and document your planning, research, implementation and reflection process in the "PPMR" section of the report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
